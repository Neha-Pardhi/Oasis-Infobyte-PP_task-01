Introduction - 

The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure that relates a person's weight and height to determine if they have a healthy body weight. It is widely used as an indicator of whether an individual is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. The BMI calculation provides a numerical value that helps assess the risk of developing certain health conditions associated with weight.
